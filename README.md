# Spanish Corpus Database
WIP 

Data comes from a corpus of Spanish language web pages (about 2 billion words) found on [corpusdata.org](https://www.corpusdata.org/spanish.asp) ([download](https://www.corpusdata.org/formats.asp)).

The data are also labelled with the country origin for each webpage source, allowing some analysis to be made on word frequency by region, which has been explored by the creators: https://www.corpusdelespanol.org/web-dial/.

My Dash app using this data is found [here](https://github.com/hannahwhyatt/corpusapp/)
